						Every person has a talent for something.<br />
						It's a pity, but only a few find their talent,<br />
						which I call "Superpower". "Superpower" manifests</br />
						itself in different aspects of life, and we are<br />
						all superheroes, but each in our own way and with<br />
						different "superpowers". Someone indispensable<br />
						parent who will raise children. Someone is a driver<br />
						who travels thousands of miles to deliver goods<br />
						to a store. Someone is a teacher who passes on his<br />
						knowledge to us, and someone is looking for his<br />
						"superpower". I believe that super power is an<br />
						activity that is not only considered your<br />
						profession but also brings you joy.
